```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))
library(lubridateExtras)
```

lubridateExtras provides functions to improve code readability and increase laziness.

## Example

Suppose you want to review transactions from the past 7 days.

Without lubridateExtras, this might look like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
transactions %>%
  filter(date >= today() - days(7))
```

Even in this straightforward example it can be difficult to remember: does the `>=` operator evaluate before or after the `-` operator?

lubridateExtra aims to remove this sort of ambiguity and make the intent clearer through convenience functions. With lubridateExtras, we could rewrite this as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
transactions %>%
  filter(date >= days_ago(7))
```

This accomplishes the exact same thing.
